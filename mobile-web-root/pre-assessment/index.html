            <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that
                can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
            <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
            <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
            <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
            <p>The &quot;alt&quot; attribute is used for screen readers and for search engine optimization, alt text appears in place where an image should load, even if it hasn't loaded yet, while the &quot;title&quot; attribute is used more for hovering
                over an image for additional information or to let a user know what they are looking at if they are unfamiliar with the image. </p>
            <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
            <p>Below is how to mark up a definition from the dictionary.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Term</dt>
                <dd>This is where the definition goes.</dd>
                <dt>University</dt>
                <dd>An insitution of higher education.</dd>
            </dl>
            <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
            <p>Here is a link to my favorite website <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com" title="YouTube" target="_blank">YouTube.com</a></p>
